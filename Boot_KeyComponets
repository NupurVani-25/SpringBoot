Spring Boot Starters- We just tell Spring Boot what kind of functionality we need; now it is responsibility of Spring Boot so that
it will ensure that the libraries needed are added to the build.

Spring Boot AutoConfigurator- Spring Boot can automatically provide configuration for application functionality common to many 
Spring applications.

Spring Boot CLI- This optional feature of Spring Boot lets you write complete applications with just application code, but no
need for a traditional project build.

Spring Boot Actuator- Gives us insight of application into what’s going on inside of a running Spring Boot application.

@SpringBootApplication = @Configuration + @ComponentScan + @EnableAutoConfiration.

Note- in Shot, Spring Boot Starter reduces build’s dependencies and Spring Boot AutoConfigurator reduces the Spring Configuration.
